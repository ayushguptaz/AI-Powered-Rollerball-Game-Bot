- Implemented a minimax search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and selective look-ahead for optimized decision-making.
- Developed an evaluation function using heuristics like piece value, pawn proximity, progression, and prioritizing captures.
- Integrated a simplifed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), improving performance on larger boards over the minimaxÂ approach
